## Problem Statement/Opportunity
1. **Access to health information**: 
   - People who might not otherwise have this information can easily obtain it thanks to online health websites. This can apply to folks who have restricted access to healthcare resources or who reside in rural places.

2. **Convenience**: 
   - From the comfort of their homes, people can easily obtain health information and resources by visiting online health websites. When considering alternative healthcare options, this can save costs and time.

3. **Empowerment**: 
   - With the help of healthbots that can answer basic questions and provide information, users can use online health portals to take charge of their own health and make educated decisions about their healthcare. Better health outcomes and a greater standard of living may result from this.

## Project Description
The HealthEase website is well-designed and most appropriate for use in medical settings, including clinics, hospitals, surgical sites, clinical laboratories, and healthcare facilities. This website facilitates the management of your medical needs by storing all patient information and physician recommendations for care.

The HealthEase website offers a range of online healthcare services. These services can include online prescription ordering, medical supply ordering, consultations with medical professionals, and access to medical resources and information. People who are unable to physically visit a healthcare center because of physical, geographic, or other limitations, as well as those who would prefer the ease of receiving healthcare services from home, can both benefit from using online healthcare websites. Online healthcare websites can also assist patients in waiting less time and lessen the burden on healthcare providers. It's crucial to remember that, even if they could be convenient, online healthcare portals should never take the place of seeking emergency medical attention in person.

A healthbot's advanced function makes it possible to answer general health-related concerns, which will benefit those who live farther away.
